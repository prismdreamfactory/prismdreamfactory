          <p>
            Prism Dream Factory is a LA based marketing strategy group that
            focuses on helping companies scale, go to market, penetrate emerging
            markets, develop products, or enhance services for platforms that
            may spread altruism and serve a greater purpose beyond monetary
            gain. We believe in order to expand the human condition and
            consciousness, we must first use the systems set in place,
            understand it, infiltrate it, and then change it while being wholly
            transparent.
